RiboDiff INSTALL
================

Before install RiboDiff, make sure the required packages are already installed on your 
computer. Please refer to README.md file for details regarding which packages are required.

This document shows how to install RiboDiff on your computer. You can either install
it globally such that every user can use it, or you can install it to your own directory.

For a global install (you need root permissions to do so), go to the package directory and
execute the following commands:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py test (optional step)
	python setup.py install

Alternatively, for a local install, execute the following commands instead:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py test (optional step)
	python setup.py install --user

This will install RiboDiff to a default location in your home directory. This location 
can vary for different operating systems. You can also install it to other location by 
executing:

	python setup.py install --prefix=/PATH/PREFIX

Please replace /PATH/PREFIX with your prefered path where RiboDiff will be installed. 
Make sure this path exists in your PATHONPATH environment variable. If not, you 
can edit PATHONPATH in your ~/.bashrc if you are using Linux or ~/.bash_profile if 
Mac OS X by adding the folowing line:

	export PYTHONPATH=/PATH/PREFIX/lib/python2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH

To run RiboDiff, all you need is to execute the TE.py in ./scripts directory:

	python ./scripts/TE.py -e <exp_outline.txt> -c <cnt_table.txt> -o <result.txt>

Probably, you may wish to have a test run on the toy data provided within this package 
after the installation. To do so, simplily excute this command:

	python ./scripts/TE.py -e ./tests/experimental_design.csv -c ./tests/gene_count_table.tab -o ./tests/toy.res.tab -d 0 -r 1 -p 1

You can find the result files with prefix name as toy.res in ./tests directory.

Please use the same TE.py script to run your own data. You can run it from anywhere on your 
computer by giving the complete path to it. Please find details on how to prepare input data 
for RiboDiff in MANUAL file in this package.
